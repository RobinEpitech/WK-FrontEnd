                    <p>For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much – the wheel, New York, wars and so on – whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.

                        But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons.</p>

                    <h1>So long</h1>
                    <p>So long and thanks for all the fish
                        So sad that it should come to this
                        We tried to warn you all but oh dear
                        
                        You may not share our intellect
                        Which might explain your disrespect
                        For all the natural wonders that
                        grow around you
                        
                        So long, so long and thanks
                        for all the fish
                        
                        The world's about to be destroyed
                        There's no point getting all annoyed
                        Lie back and let the planet dissolve
                        
                        Despite those nets of tuna fleets
                        We thought that most of you were sweet
                        Especially tiny tots
                        And your pregnant women
                        
                        So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
                        So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
                        So long, so long and thanks
                        For all the fish
                        
                        If I had just one last wish
                        I would like a tasty fish
                        If we could just change one thing
                        We would all have learned to sing.
                        Come one and all, man and Mammal
                        Side by Side in life's great gene pool
                        
                        So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
                        So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
                        So long, so long and thanks!
                        For all the fish.</p>
